The tool set which I have chosen to automate is as below

•	Selenium Webdriver with Java <br/>
•	Maven for Dependency Management <br/>
•	Robot Framework for Behaviour Driven Development using Keywords (similar to cucumber) <br/>
•	Robot Framework for Test reporting <br/>
•	Eclipse as IDE <br/>
•	Git <br/>

The reasons, I have chosen this tool set is that, I am trying to create a framework which can be easily scalable, easily maintainable and easily readable, along with having the below attributes.

•	All are open source tools <br/>
•	Integrated framework for Mobile, Web and API automation <br/>
•	Great reporting structure using Robot Framework <br/>
•	Ease of using Selenium with Java <br/>
•	Platform independent <br/>
•	Cross browser testing <br/>
•	Implementing BDD with ease. <br/>

Pre-requisites for running the code are as below.

•	Java 8 JDK <br/>
•	Maven <br/>
•	Google Chrome Driver and Gecko driver set to path with supported versions of browsers for respective drivers <br/>

Also, please find the below link for the demo video of the automation framework, which I have worked on to automate the cases for web application.

Please feel free to clone the repo, review the code and run the code.

The project can be run from terminal/command prompt by

cd <project_location> mvn robotframework:run

The above command would execute the project.
