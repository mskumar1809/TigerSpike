# TigerSpike

The tool set which I have choosen to automate is as below

Selenium Webdriver with Java
Maven for Dependency Management
Robot Framework for Behaviour Driven Development using Keywords (similar to cucumber)
Eclipse as IDE
Git
The reasons, I have choosen this tool set is that, I am trying to create a framework which can be easily scalable, easily maintainable and easily readable, along with having the below attributes.

All are open source tools
Integrated framework for Mobile, Web and API automation
Great reporting structure using Robot Framework
Ease of using Selenium with Java
Platform independent
Cross browser testing
Implementing BDD with ease.
Pre-requisites for running the code are as below.

Java 8 JDK
Maven
Google Chrome Driver and Gecko driver set to path with supported versions of browsers for respective drivers

Also, please find the below link for the demo video of the automation framework, which I have worked on to automate the cases for both mobile and web.

<TBD>

Please feel free to clone the repo, review the code and run the code.

The project can be run from terminal/command prompt by

cd <project_location> mvn robotframework:run

The above command would execute the project.
